# InverseKinematics

This IK solver is not an implementation of CCD (Cyclyc coordinat descent) or other Ik methods. Rather it is my own aproach and take on inverse kinematics. While it may look and behave similarly to these solvers, I have figured out the math and methods to resolve IK on my own and thus while this ma not be as efficient or optimized as pre-ecxisting methds, it is nonetheless a method I fully understand which in returns gives me a better understanding of IK and it's constraints and possible flaws. I may in the future implement CCD or another algorithm or a hybrid between different methods.
